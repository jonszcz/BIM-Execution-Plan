*UPDATE*: This project is abandoned in it's current form. It lives on as a project rewritten in markdown and processed with pandoc and MAKE files.
---

== Intro
The intention of this repository is to prepare a series of documents that the firm can rely on to use as an starting point for each project's BIM Execution Plan (BxP).
While we do currently have a Word document outlining the firm's BxP, we have found that once each project modifies the document to be specific to their project, those revisions are lost for future users.
By placing these thoughts on GitHub, we are able to use version control as well as branching and merging to begin to have a central hub where we can review and manage all the project BxPs.

This document has been rewritten in Asciidoc format for several reasons:

1. It allows for the content of the document to be separate from the styling of the document.
Often times more time is wasted getting the style and formatting to be "correct" rather than focusing on the content of the text itself.

2. By rewritting in a markdown language, we now have the ability to scale the final output to a variety of end uses.
We can use the the .adoc to export to a static HTML or wiki, export to Word, print to PDF, or a variety of other formats all using Pandoc.
Further instructions will be included in the repository as they are developed.

== TODO
.Document Format
- [x] Break apart the sections into individual files
- [x] Create a main page that includes the TOC and multiple `include` functions
- [ ] Create tables for the locations where we define users, roles and email addresses
- [ ] Update documents to include .adoc image references

.Content
- [ ] Replace all instances of `Project Name` with a substitution that is defined in the YAML
- [ ] Replace all instances of `Client` with a substitution that is defined in the YAML
- [ ] Replace all instances of `Client` with a substitution that is defined in the YAML

== Usage
Each project team should fork the repo, and then modify the contents of the BxP to suit their needs.
If, upon review with a memeber of the DesignTech or PM team, modifications are determined be suitable to update the overall template, a Pull request can be offered to the main.
Additionally, if modifications to the template have been made, and the project team wants to use those changes, they can rebase from the master template.
Further instructions will be provided as they are developed.
