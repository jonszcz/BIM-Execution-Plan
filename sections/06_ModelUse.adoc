== Model Use
=== BIM Goals
The Building Information Modeling will be used on this project for the following goals. All models should be developed in a way that ensures these goals are achieved.  The BIM model(s) being developed by the design teams will be developed with the highlighted goals in mind.  The BIM model will also be developed to allow the construction manager team and campus operations team to reference the design BIM model as a guide and to develop their own internal BIM models.
